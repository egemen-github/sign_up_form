# sign_up_form
Itâ€™s a sign-up form for an imaginary service.

This project assignment is from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/intermediate-html-and-css-sign-up-form) curriculum.

This Sign Up Form is not mobile focused as it is only for practicing what we have learned about CSS and Forms.
